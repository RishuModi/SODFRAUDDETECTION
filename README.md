This C++ program is designed to detect conflicts in user roles and privileges based on Segregation of Duties (SOD) rules. It reads data from CSV files, processes mappings between users, roles, privileges, and entities, and checks for conflicts using predefined SOD rules. The program outputs detected conflicts to a CSV file for further analysis.

Features
CSV Data Loading: Reads user-to-role, role-to-privilege, and privilege-to-entity mappings from CSV files.

SOD Rule Enforcement: Loads and enforces SOD rules to detect conflicting privileges assigned to users.

Conflict Detection: Identifies conflicts using exact and substring matching for privileges.

Output Generation: Generates a CSV file containing detected conflicts with details like user, role, privilege, entity, and position.

Debugging Tools: Includes a debug mode to print loaded mappings for verification.

How It Works
Input Files:

XX_3_USER_ROLE_MAPPING_RPT.csv: Maps users to their assigned roles.

XX_6_PVLG_TO_ROLE_RELATION_RPT.csv: Maps roles to their associated privileges.

XX_7_PVLGS_MASTER_RPT.csv: Maps privileges to their associated entities.

SOD_Ruleset.csv: Contains SOD rules defining conflicting privileges.

Process:

Loads CSV data into appropriate data structures.

Iterates through users, roles, and privileges to detect conflicts using SOD rules.

Writes detected conflicts to an output CSV file (conflict_results.csv).

Conflict Detection Logic:

Checks for exact matches between privileges in SOD rules.

Performs substring matching to identify partial conflicts (e.g., CREATE_USER conflicts with DELETE_USER).

Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).

CSV Files: Prepare the input CSV files as described above.

Steps to Run
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sod-conflict-detector.git
cd sod-conflict-detector
Compile the Program:


g++ -o sod_detector main.cpp
Run the Program:


./sod_detector
Check Output:

The program will generate a file named conflict_results.csv containing detected conflicts.

Debugging
To debug and verify the loaded mappings, enable the debugPrintMappings function in the main function. It will print the following:

SOD Rules

User-to-Roles Mapping

Role-to-Privileges Mapping
